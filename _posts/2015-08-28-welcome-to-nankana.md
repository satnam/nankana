Nankana is a [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) of a popular Jekyll theme called [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com). Hyde is based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), both of which were developed by GitHub's [Mark Otto](http://markdotto.com).

Nankana is hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). It was created as a resource for the Sikh community to build websites that are designed mobile first. With more and more smartphones and tablets in use today, it is important that websites are fast and function without any friction, especially on these new devices.
